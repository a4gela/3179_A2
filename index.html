It has since kept an active and uninterrupted record of shark-human interactions, from incidents reporting back from 1791 until now.

                <p>The number of recorded shark incidents has increased since 1791, with drastic increases starting to occur from 1970 and onwards. The steep decrease in 2020 can be attributed to lockdown rules due to COVID-19.
